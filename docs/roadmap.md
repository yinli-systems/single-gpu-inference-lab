# Roadmap

Single-GPU Inference Lab is an evidence-driven LLM inference systems workspace
for real single-card serving. The primary measurement target remains NVIDIA L20
48 GB, but the project should win by being reproducible, honest about limits,
and portable enough to use A100 controls when they sharpen a claim.

## Positioning

The flagship story:

> A reference stack for training, fine-tuning, serving, benchmarking, and publishing LLM experiments on one L20 GPU, with every claim tied to a config, command, and measured artifact.

The project should avoid broad framework claims until the implementation earns them. The first public narrative should be narrow:

- single-GPU reproducibility
- QLoRA-first fine-tuning
- memory planning before job launch
- benchmark reports that include latency, throughput, and peak memory
- model cards generated from experiment manifests

The next kernel-serving narrative is narrower and more valuable than a generic
KV-cache wishlist: use the L20 KV/decode pipeline in
`docs/l20-kv-decode-pipeline-blueprint.md` to connect PagedAttention, prefix
caching, FP8 KV, sparse logits processing, and MLA/GQA-style compression into
measured serving ablations.

## Version Plan

### v0.1: Reproducible QLoRA Baseline

Goal: one real fine-tuning path that can run on a single L20 and be verified from config to output.

Deliverables:

- QLoRA training entry point with PEFT, Transformers, Accelerate, and bitsandbytes.
- Tiny checked-in JSONL fixture for smoke tests.
- Real dataset config path or Hugging Face dataset switch.
- Training report containing command, model, dataset, hyperparameters, peak memory, runtime, and final loss.
- Basic benchmark harness for tokens/sec and memory around the training loop.
- `make verify` or `python -m l20_stack.verify` for local checks.

Acceptance:

- Smoke training runs without downloading a large model.
- Real L20 run completes with recorded peak memory.
- Tests pass without CUDA.
- No raw dataset, checkpoint, token, or secret is committed.

### v0.2: Model Card and Experiment Matrix

Goal: make every run publishable and comparable.

Deliverables:

- Hugging Face model card generator from experiment manifest and result JSON.
- Preset matrix for train, eval, serve, and quantization configs.
- Result schema for metrics and hardware metadata.
- Experiment index under `runs/` or `outputs/`, ignored by Git, with exportable summaries.
- Documentation for reproducing a run from a clean checkout.

Acceptance:

- A model card can be generated without manual editing.
- Presets validate before launch.
- A completed run produces a machine-readable report and a Markdown summary.

### v0.3: Serving and Quantization Baselines

Goal: measure inference before optimizing it.

Deliverables:

- vLLM baseline serving command.
- Request fixture format for prompt length, output length, batch shape, and concurrency.
- Benchmark harness for prefill latency, decode tokens/sec, p50/p95 latency, and peak memory.
- Quantization preset comparison.
- Report template for repeated runs on the same hardware.

Acceptance:

- One model has a serving baseline on L20.
- Benchmark results include raw JSON and rendered Markdown.
- Any optimization proposal points to a measured bottleneck.

### v1.0: Publishable Domain Model

Goal: use the stack to produce one real, documented model artifact.

Candidate directions:

- code assistant tuning
- finance-domain reasoning
- Chinese-English technical assistant

Deliverables:

- One released model or adapter.
- Model card with intended use, data summary, limitations, evals, and reproduction command.
- Training and serving reports.
- Baseline comparisons against the base model.
- Public-facing README that links code, model card, and benchmark report.

Acceptance:

- The model artifact can be loaded by a clean user.
- Evaluation claims are reproducible from checked-in configs.
- Known limitations are documented, including single-GPU constraints.

## Commit Plan

## Verification Gates

Every commit:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src /usr/bin/python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/private/tmp/single-gpu-infer-pycache PYTHONPATH=src /usr/bin/python3 -m compileall -q src tests
git diff --check
```

Before every push:

```bash
grep -RInE "(gho_[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,}|ghp_[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,}|sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}|hf_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|BEGIN (RSA|OPENSSH|EC) PRIVATE KEY)" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=__pycache__
```

Before any public claim:

- Re-run the command from a clean checkout.
- Record hardware, driver, CUDA, Python, package versions, and config hash.
- Keep raw outputs outside Git but export summaries into docs.
- Mark unmeasured performance as hypothesis, not result.
