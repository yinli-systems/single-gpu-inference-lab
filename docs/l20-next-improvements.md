# L20 Next Improvements

This note turns the current research direction into executable repo work. The
success criterion for every item is a JSON result under `benchmarks/results/`
and a conservative dispatch decision. Microbenchmarks are useful only when they
explain an end-to-end result.

## 1. Q/K Norm + Q/K RoPE + KV Write Fusion

Current entry point:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/home/hhai/vllm-l20-upstream:/home/hhai/l20-stack \
  python scripts/benchmark_qk_norm_rope_kv.py \
  --output benchmarks/results/l20-qk-norm-rope-kv/qwen3-0.6b-l20.json
```

Goal: reduce low-batch decode kernel count by folding Q norm, K norm, Q RoPE,
K RoPE, and KV write into one L20 SM89 path. This is the closest match to the
vLLM 2026 DeepSeek fusion direction, where small attention-path operations were
collapsed to reduce launch overhead.

Gate: only consider a vLLM serving hook after the fused path beats the existing
vLLM fused QK-norm/RoPE plus cache-write boundary on correctness and latency for
Qwen3-style shapes.

L20 result so far:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-qk-norm-rope-kv/qwen3-next-v2.json
tokens 1:  0.00939 ms baseline -> 0.00639 ms fused, 1.47x, correct
tokens 8:  0.00974 ms baseline -> 0.00667 ms fused, 1.46x, correct
tokens 16: 0.00993 ms baseline -> 0.00770 ms fused, 1.29x, correct
tokens 32: 0.01054 ms baseline -> 0.00808 ms fused, 1.30x, correct
tokens 64: 0.01165 ms baseline -> 0.00926 ms fused, 1.26x, correct
```

This is a real low-token microbenchmark win on L20. It is not yet an end-to-end
ITL claim; the next gate is a vLLM decode run with the fused path enabled.

A full O2 serving matrix with vLLM's native `enable_qk_norm_rope_fusion` gate
enabled on Qwen3-0.6B produced the following paired result:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-qk-norm-rope-serving/qwen3-0p6b-o2-full-v1/
18 reports per variant: inputs 512/1024, max concurrency 1/4/16, 3 runs each
output throughput: +1.618%
mean ITL:           -0.935%
median ITL:         -1.221%
p99 ITL:            -1.427%
mean TTFT:          -3.804%
```

The per-shape result is not uniformly positive: c16/i1024 regresses by +0.364%
mean ITL and +0.299% median ITL, while P99 ITL still improves by -10.820%.
This matrix shows that the Q/K norm + RoPE boundary can move real decode ITL
under O2/CUDA graph settings, but the effect size is low-single-digit and it is
not yet the L20 three-way fused kernel. The current compiler-pass gap is
structural: vLLM has one pass for Q/K RMSNorm+RoPE and another pass for RoPE+KV
cache update, and these pattern replacements do not compose into a single
side-effecting Q/K norm + Q/K RoPE + KV write op. The upstreamable
implementation should add a custom op following the `unified_kv_cache_update`
dependency style, then register a single pattern that matches `qkv -> split ->
q/k norm -> rotary -> attention cache update`.

The paged-decode RFC path now has an O2/CUDA graph serving smoke across
Qwen3-0.6B, Qwen3-1.7B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-vllm-paged-decode-o2/
Qwen3-0.6B O2:              output -0.026%, mean ITL -0.056%
Qwen3-1.7B O2:              output +0.011%, mean ITL -0.069%
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B O2:      output -0.039%, mean ITL +0.314%
```

This means the O2 execution path is no longer the main blocker for the isolated
paged-decode hook. The serving boundary is too small. The next Q/K norm work
should be evaluated as a larger fused boundary, not as another isolated decode
kernel tweak.

## 2. FP8 KV Fused Attention Kernel Boundary

Current entries:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/benchmark_paged_fp8_kv_decode_attention.py
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/benchmark_cuda_paged_fp8_decode.py
```

Current conclusion: fused FP8 dequant beats materializing K/V, but the current
split-decode structure is still slower than BF16 predequantized attention. The
next implementation has to put FP8 K/V tile load, dequant, QK, online softmax,
PV, and rescale in the same paged attention kernel boundary.

Gate: do not enable `should_use_l20_paged_fp8_split_kv` until a real vLLM FP8
KV-cache ITL run beats the FlashInfer baseline.

External baseline: vLLM's 2026 FP8 KV-cache study frames the expected win as a
lower decode ITL slope from reduced KV-cache traffic, with reported strong
results on Hopper/Blackwell paths. The same writeup also calls out fixed
overheads, model structure, head dimension, sliding-window layers, and
accumulation/register-pressure tradeoffs as cases where FP8 does not translate
into end-to-end speed. Our L20 data fits the latter pattern: first-token or
single-run wins appear, but repeated median TTFT and E2E do not hold up yet.

## 3. vLLM FlashInfer Sampling Route Hardening

Current entry:

```bash
scripts/run_vllm_l20_sampling_campaign.sh MODEL SERVED_NAME flashinfer OUTPUT_DIR
scripts/run_vllm_l20_sampling_campaign.sh MODEL SERVED_NAME torch OUTPUT_DIR
scripts/run_vllm_l20_sampling_campaign.sh MODEL SERVED_NAME l20 OUTPUT_DIR
```

Goal: make stochastic serving reliably stay on FlashInfer sampling, including
prewarm, path inspection, and CPU/PyTorch fallback detection.

Gate: every serving report must include `sampling-path.json`, and the summary
must show no suspected CPU fallback before claiming an ITL improvement.

L20 finding: the first minimal vLLM serving smoke hit FlashInfer 0.6.12
sampling JIT failure before the server became healthy:

```text
flashinfer/sampling.cuh: BlockAdjacentDifference<..., 512, ...> has no member FlagHeads
```

The hardened campaign now treats this as a preflight failure, writes
`flashinfer-prewarm.json` plus `sampling-path.json`, and exits before any ITL
claim. The next valid sampling comparison requires a working CUDA 13 nvcc /
FlashInfer / CCCL combination on the target host.

After preserving the active Python environment's `bin/` on `PATH`, the
FlashInfer sampling prewarm advanced past the missing-`ninja` failure and the
server reached vLLM initialization. The current remaining blocker on the shared
L20 is CUDA OOM during vLLM warmup/cudagraph capture while another GPU service is
resident. The wrapper now writes `sampling-path.json` for this server-start
failure too, so failed runs remain auditable.

Current ceiling update: the serving NSYS family summaries show that standalone
sampling/logits-processor kernels peak at 3.42% of recorded GPU time, and the
best standalone LM-head candidate is still 1.022x of full logits. Those
profiles motivate an upstream GEMM/GEMV epilogue or logits boundary that
preserves the optimized LM-head path; they do not rely on the withdrawn custom
sampler latency comparison. See
`benchmarks/results/l20-serving-optimization-ceiling/`.

The upstream scout maps that target onto concrete vLLM files. The current local
checkout shows `GPUModelRunner.sample()` computing full logits before calling
the sampler, `LogitsProcessor._get_logits()` producing logits through
`lm_head.quant_method.apply`, and the GPU sampler copying/mutating full logits
before temperature/top-k/top-p/gumbel sampling. The first patch should be
trace-only and narrow-gated: L20 opt-in, decode-only, TP=1, no logprobs, no
grammar, no speculative rejection, no per-request generators, and simple
top-k/top-p/temperature. See
`benchmarks/results/l20-vllm-logits-boundary-scout/`.

That trace-only patch is now implemented as
`integrations/vllm/install_l20_logits_boundary_trace.py`. It copies
`l20_logits_boundary_trace.py` into vLLM and injects one call after
`compute_logits()` in `GPUModelRunner.sample()`. The hook is disabled unless
`VLLM_L20_LOGITS_BOUNDARY_TRACE` points to a JSONL path, and it never mutates
logits or sampler state. Use
`scripts/summarize_l20_logits_boundary_trace.py` to turn the serving trace into
an eligible/fallback breakdown before writing any CUTLASS or Triton epilogue.
For the full evidence run, use
`scripts/run_vllm_l20_logits_boundary_trace_campaign.sh`; it installs the trace
hook into a vLLM source checkout, runs the serving matrix, and emits
`campaign-summary.json` plus a per-campaign `README.md`.

The first kernel implementation is intentionally still outside vLLM:
`scripts/benchmark_l20_topk_topp_sampling.py` compares a self-written L20
two-stage top-k/top-p sampler against PyTorch, CPU round-trip, and FlashInfer.
It uses caller-provided GPU uniforms so correctness can be exact before wiring
the path to vLLM's RNG/Philox state.

That path has now run through real serving. The vLLM hook in
`integrations/vllm/install_l20_topk_topp_sampler.py` reaches the custom path
for 4251/4253 trace events. Its recorded 32.36%/32.06% median-ITL deltas are
superseded because the candidate used the pre-audit nucleus mask; they cannot
accept or reject the corrected hook. The path proof and kernel-count profile
still motivate either a compiled vLLM sampler integration with seed/offset
state and CUDA graph capture, or a logits/LM-head epilogue that avoids
materializing full logits before top-k/top-p/multinomial. Artifacts live under
`benchmarks/results/l20-vllm-sampling-itl/`.

The positive serving result is the production FlashInfer route, not the custom
standalone hook. `benchmarks/results/l20-vllm-sampling-winner/` compares
torch/native sampling with FlashInfer sampling across Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B,
Qwen3-0.6B, and Qwen3-1.7B using c1/c4, i512/o32, three-run medians. The strict
gate requires both lower median ITL and higher output throughput. FlashInfer
passes 5/6 pairs and all c4 pairs; c4 median ITL improves 4.35%-7.84%, and c4
output throughput improves 3.46%-6.69%. The one non-strict case still improves
median ITL but misses throughput by 0.05%, so the gate remains conservative.

The follow-up matrix is now automated by
`scripts/run_vllm_l20_sampling_winner_matrix.sh`. On Qwen3-0.6B i512/o32 with
five-run medians, FlashInfer strict-wins at c2, c4, and c8, with median ITL
improvements of 8.07%, 8.73%, and 3.63%. The c1/o32 case still improves median
ITL by 2.49% but loses output throughput by 1.05%, so it remains an ITL-only
signal. A c1/i512/o128 follow-up strict-wins, with median ITL -2.39% and output
throughput +3.85%, which shows the short-output c1 miss is mostly launch/TTFT
noise rather than a FlashInfer route regression. Artifacts live under
`benchmarks/results/l20-vllm-sampling-winner-v2/`.

## 4. Spec Decode Acceptance-Rate Study

New entries:

```bash
scripts/run_vllm_l20_spec_acceptance_campaign.sh MODEL SERVED_NAME off OUTPUT_DIR

SPECULATIVE_ARGS='...' \
  scripts/run_vllm_l20_spec_acceptance_campaign.sh MODEL SERVED_NAME custom OUTPUT_DIR
```

`SPECULATIVE_ARGS` is intentionally passed through instead of hard-coded because
vLLM speculative CLI flags have changed across versions. The companion parser
extracts acceptance evidence from logs when the runtime emits it:

```bash
python scripts/summarize_spec_decode_acceptance.py \
  --log OUTPUT_DIR/server.log \
  --result-dir OUTPUT_DIR \
  --output OUTPUT_DIR/spec-acceptance-summary.json
```

Gate: do not write another speculative attention kernel until the measured
draft acceptance rate and verifier timing show that verification, not draft
quality or scheduling, is the bottleneck.

## 5. Multi-Turn KV Pressure Benchmark

New entry for a running OpenAI-compatible server:

```bash
python scripts/benchmark_multiturn_kv_pressure.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
  --model SERVED_NAME \
  --turns 8 \
  --prefix-chars 24000 \
  --max-tokens 32 \
  --output benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/example.json
```

Server wrapper:

```bash
PREFIX_CACHING=0 MAX_MODEL_LEN=4096 ENFORCE_EAGER=1 \
  scripts/run_vllm_l20_kv_pressure_campaign.sh \
  MODEL SERVED_NAME benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/no-prefix-cache

PREFIX_CACHING=1 MAX_MODEL_LEN=4096 ENFORCE_EAGER=1 \
  scripts/run_vllm_l20_kv_pressure_campaign.sh \
  MODEL SERVED_NAME benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/prefix-cache
```

BF16/FP8 matrix wrapper:

```bash
KV_DTYPES="auto fp8" PREFIX_MODES="0 1" \
MAX_MODEL_LEN=2048 TURNS=4 PREFIX_CHARS=4096 OUTPUT_TOKENS=16 \
VLLM_EXTRA_ARGS="--gpu-memory-utilization 0.45 --max-num-seqs 1 --max-num-batched-tokens 1024" \
scripts/run_vllm_l20_kv_pressure_matrix.sh \
  MODEL SERVED_NAME benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-matrix-v1
```

The matrix writes one subdirectory per `kv_cache_dtype × prefix_caching` pair
and finishes with `kv-pressure-summary.json`, including success rows and
server-start failures. This is the first required end-to-end gate before
building INT8/4-bit/adaptive KV-cache kernels.

Goal: model the workload that matters for L20 GDDR6: long resident prefixes,
many short turns, and increasing KV-cache pressure. This is the prerequisite
for testing INT8/4-bit/adaptive KV-cache policies without confusing kernel
speed with workload memory pressure.

Gate: KV compression work should report TTFT/ITL over turns, not only a single
decode microbenchmark.

Current blocker: the first real vLLM smoke on the shared L20 failed during
server warmup with CUDA OOM while another non-l20-stack GPU service was running.
The benchmark harness is ready, but this result is an environment-capacity
blocker rather than evidence for or against the KV-pressure method.

Tiny shared-GPU smoke:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-tiny-summary-v1.json
Qwen3-0.6B, max_model_len=512, turns=1, prefix_chars=256, output_tokens=4
BF16/auto KV: TTFT 81.19 ms, E2E 106.75 ms
FP8 KV:       TTFT 88.06 ms, E2E 115.61 ms
```

This is only a startup-capable sanity check. It shows that both BF16 and vLLM
FP8 KV-cache serving paths can run on the current shared L20 with aggressive
memory limits, but the context is too short for FP8 KV bandwidth savings to
amortize scale/quant overhead. The next meaningful run must increase turns and
prefix length on a clean GPU window.

4K shared-GPU pressure result:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-pressure-4k-v1/kv-pressure-summary.json
Qwen3-0.6B, max_model_len=8192, turns=4, prefix_chars=4096, output_tokens=16
prefix_cache=0
BF16/auto KV: median TTFT 49.84 ms, median E2E 238.58 ms
FP8 KV:       median TTFT 37.83 ms, median E2E 245.29 ms
```

This is the first useful signal for the KV-pressure direction: FP8 KV improves
median TTFT by about 24% over BF16/auto KV when prefix caching is disabled, but
does not improve median end-to-end latency in this short-output run.

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-pressure-4k-prefix-v1/kv-pressure-summary.json
same shape, prefix_cache=1
BF16/auto KV: median TTFT 48.05 ms, median E2E 240.82 ms
FP8 KV:       median TTFT 47.53 ms, median E2E 243.46 ms
```

With prefix caching enabled, FP8 KV is roughly tied on median TTFT and still
slightly slower on E2E. The next experiment should push to longer resident
prefixes and more turns, then measure whether late-turn TTFT scales better for
FP8 before implementing a custom INT8/4-bit KV cache.

8K shared-GPU pressure result:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-pressure-8k-v1/kv-pressure-summary.json
Qwen3-0.6B, max_model_len=16384, turns=8, prefix_chars=8192, output_tokens=16
prefix_cache=0
BF16/auto KV: median TTFT 55.99 ms, median E2E 242.67 ms
FP8 KV:       median TTFT 67.32 ms, median E2E 267.20 ms
```

Without prefix caching, FP8 KV regresses at 8K. That means the 4K no-cache TTFT
win is not stable enough to justify a custom FP8 kernel by itself.

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-pressure-8k-prefix-v1/kv-pressure-summary.json
same shape, prefix_cache=1
BF16/auto KV: median TTFT 47.96 ms, median E2E 238.20 ms
FP8 KV:       median TTFT 38.33 ms, median E2E 233.88 ms
```

With prefix caching enabled, FP8 KV improves median TTFT by about 20% and also
slightly improves median E2E. This is now the strongest serving-level evidence
for continuing the L20 KV-compression line: the target workload should be
cached long prefixes with repeated short turns, not raw no-cache decode.

16K cached-prefix follow-up:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-pressure-16k-prefix-v1/kv-pressure-summary.json
Qwen3-0.6B, max_model_len=32768, turns=8, prefix_chars=16384, output_tokens=16
prefix_cache=1
BF16/auto KV: median TTFT 61.23 ms, median E2E 243.37 ms
FP8 KV:       median TTFT 61.27 ms, median E2E 261.85 ms
```

The FP8 advantage does not grow monotonically with prefix length. At 16K it is
TTFT-neutral and E2E-negative, even though the first turn is slightly faster.
The combined summary in
`benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-cached-prefix-summary-v1.json` shows
an 8K sweet spot on this shared L20 run: FP8 gives 1.25x median TTFT and 1.41x
last-turn TTFT at 8K, but only 1.00x and 0.95x at 16K. The next gate is repeated
8K cached-prefix runs, not a new quantized KV kernel yet.

8K repeated-run gate:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen3-8k-prefix-repeats-summary-v1.json
Qwen3-0.6B, max_model_len=16384, turns=8, prefix_chars=8192, output_tokens=16
prefix_cache=1, paired runs=3
FP8/BF16 median TTFT speedup: median 1.05x, range 0.99x-1.25x
FP8/BF16 last-turn TTFT speedup: median 1.07x
FP8/BF16 median E2E speedup: median 0.96x
```

The repeated runs do not support a robust FP8 serving win. The first 8K run was
real but not stable enough to justify a custom fused FP8/4-bit KV kernel. The
next useful step is either a larger model where KV bandwidth dominates more, or
Nsight-backed profiling of why vLLM FP8 KV adds enough overhead to erase the
bandwidth savings on Qwen3-0.6B.

Larger-model check:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure/qwen25-coder-15b-8k-prefix-v1/kv-pressure-summary.json
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct, max_model_len=16384, turns=8,
prefix_chars=8192, output_tokens=16, prefix_cache=1
BF16/auto KV: median TTFT 44.78 ms, median E2E 211.80 ms
FP8 KV:       median TTFT 45.45 ms, median E2E 219.52 ms
```

The 1.5B check does not rescue the FP8 KV hypothesis. FP8 improves first-turn
TTFT by 1.25x, but median TTFT is 0.99x and median E2E is 0.96x versus BF16.
This reinforces the gate: do not implement a custom FP8/4-bit KV kernel until
profiling identifies removable overhead in the vLLM FP8 path.

Nsight profile entry:

```bash
NCU_OUTPUT_PREFIX=benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure-ncu/qwen3-8k-fp8 \
NCU_KERNEL_NAME='regex:.*(flashinfer|paged|attention|decode).*' \
NCU_LAUNCH_SKIP=20 NCU_LAUNCH_COUNT=5 \

scripts/run_vllm_l20_kv_pressure_campaign.sh \
  MODEL SERVED_NAME benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure-ncu/qwen3-8k-fp8
```

Use this to compare BF16/auto and FP8 runs on DRAM throughput, L2 traffic,
active warps, and long-scoreboard stalls before writing a new kernel.

Current Nsight status: the L20 host has Nsight Compute installed
(`/usr/local/cuda-13.0/bin/ncu`). Counter access is now available through a
narrow root wrapper (`/tmp/ncu-root`) that only permits Nsight Compute, not broad
passwordless sudo. The first root-counter smoke is:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure-ncu/qwen3-ncu-root-smoke/profile.json
reshape_and_cache_flash_kernel, duration 2.72 us
DRAM 11.29 GB/s, L2 hit 87.57%, active warps 32.61%, reg/thread 40
long-scoreboard ratio 21.82, tensor pipe 0%
```

This smoke proves the Nsight permission and JSON/Markdown export path. It is
not a serving bottleneck diagnosis because the profiled kernel is a tiny cache
write during server startup.

The attempted direct vLLM HTTP-server profile also established an important
boundary:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-kv-pressure-ncu/qwen3-8k-auto-root-v1/kv-pressure-failure.json
status: server_start_failed
reason: server_process_exited_before_health
```

With a small `--launch-count`, Nsight Compute finishes its startup-kernel window
before the long-lived vLLM server becomes healthy. Therefore, serving ITL must
continue to be measured with the HTTP benchmark harness, while kernel roofline
diagnosis should use deterministic standalone workloads that exit normally.

Fresh standalone decode-attention Nsight result:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-decode-attention-ncu/root-b1-c4096-best/profile.json
_gqa_decode_attention_partial_kernel, batch=1, context=4096
duration 47.68 us, DRAM 405.81 GB/s, L2 hit 50.50%
active warps 11.77%, reg/thread 72, long-scoreboard ratio 4.75
SM throughput 13.55%, tensor pipe 0%
```

This confirms the next attention-kernel bottleneck: the current split-KV path is
still scalar/LSU dominated and does not use Tensor Cores. The next serious
kernel implementation should either introduce a Tensor-Core tiled QK/PV path
for shapes where occupancy survives, or reduce register pressure enough to raise
resident warps before trying more FP8/4-bit KV-cache variants.

Tensor-Core candidate follow-up:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-decode-attention-tc/smoke-b1-c512.json
batch=1, context=512, q_heads=16, kv_heads=8
scalar split-KV: 0.0922 ms
grouped-Q tl.dot candidate: 0.0850 ms, correct, 1.08x

benchmarks/results/l20-decode-attention-tc/b1-c4096-v1.json
batch=1, context=4096
best scalar split-KV: 0.0758 ms
best grouped-Q tl.dot candidate: 0.0804 ms, correct, 0.94x

benchmarks/results/l20-decode-attention-tc/b16-c4096-v1.json
batch=16, context=4096
best scalar split-KV: 0.4214 ms
best grouped-Q tl.dot candidate: 0.4285 ms, correct, 0.98x
```

The candidate proves that grouped Q heads can trigger Tensor Cores on L20, but
the current tile is not a dispatch win. Nsight for the candidate:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-decode-attention-tc-ncu/b1-c4096-tc-v1/profile.json
_gqa_decode_attention_tc_partial_kernel, batch=1, context=4096
duration 32.03 us, DRAM 586.32 GB/s, L2 hit 1.77%
active warps 8.33%, reg/thread 150, Tensor pipe v2 12.47%
```

Compared with the scalar partial kernel, the tensor-core candidate reduces
partial-kernel time from 47.68 us to 32.03 us and raises DRAM throughput from
405.81 to 586.32 GB/s. The cost is severe: registers rise from 72 to 150,
active warps fall from 11.77% to 8.33%, and L2 hit rate collapses from 50.50%
to 1.77%. This explains why the full split+reduce latency does not improve.

Gate: keep `gqa_decode_attention_split_kv_tensor_core_candidate` experimental
only. The next implementation should reduce the candidate's register/shared
memory footprint before expanding it, for example by splitting QK and PV tiling
or lowering the live `(BLOCK_Q, head_dim)` accumulator pressure. Do not wire this
path into vLLM dispatch until it beats scalar split-KV on both b1/c4096 and
b16/c4096 with stable p50/p90.

D-split low-register follow-up:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-decode-attention-tc-dsplit/b1-c4096-sweep-v1.json
batch=1, context=4096, split_size=512
best scalar split-KV: 0.0758 ms
best grouped-Q tl.dot candidate: 0.0809 ms
best grouped-Q D-split candidate: 0.0819 ms

benchmarks/results/l20-decode-attention-tc-dsplit-ncu/b1-c4096-dsplit-v1/profile.json
_gqa_decode_attention_tc_dsplit_partial_kernel
duration 32.99 us, DRAM 589.11 GB/s, L2 hit 34.29%
active warps 11.62%, reg/thread 128, Tensor pipe v2 17.81%
```

The D-split experiment did exactly what it was designed to test: it reduced
register pressure from 150 to 128, raised active warps from 8.33% to 11.62%, and
restored L2 hit rate from 1.77% to 34.29%. It still does not win full latency,
because splitting the output dimension repeats the QK/softmax work for each
D-block. That makes this design useful as a diagnosis, but not as the next
implementation path.

Updated gate: do not continue with D-split as written. The next Tensor-Core
attempt must share QK scores/online-softmax state across the full head dimension
instead of recomputing them per D-block, or move effort to reduce-inline /
epilogue fusion where the current split-KV path already pays a second kernel
launch.

BF16 partial-output reduce experiment:

batch=1, context=4096, split_size=512

BF16 partial reduce: 3.81 us, DRAM 11.60 GB/s, L2 hit 62.77%
```

The BF16 partial-output candidate proves the reduce stage's vector traffic can
be cut, but the kernel gets slower because conversion and scoreboard behavior
offset the smaller memory footprint. This closes the simplest epilogue
compression idea: the reduce kernel is too small for partial-vector bandwidth
alone to be the main limiter. A useful next split-KV optimization needs to
remove the reduce launch or merge partials inside a different work mapping,
not just compress the intermediate buffer.

Prefix-aware packed decode attention v1:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/home/hhai/l20-stack/src /home/hhai/venvs/vllm-l20/bin/python \
  scripts/benchmark_shared_prefix_decode_attention.py \
  --batches 4,8,16 \

  --warmup 10 \
  --iterations 40 \
  --output benchmarks/results/l20-shared-prefix-decode/b4-b16-c1k-c8k-v1.json
```

This experiment targets the exact workload that normal split-KV decode wastes
on L20: multiple active requests reading the same long system prompt or cached
prefix from GDDR6. The v1 kernel only handles a contiguous shared prefix and
does not yet merge per-request suffix tokens.

16    8192    0.35635 ms         0.18842 ms          1.89x
```

The result is the first clean positive signal after the tensor-core and partial
reduce dead ends: packing shared-prefix requests wins when the batch is large
enough to amortize the wider `(request, GQA-group)` tile. It also proves the
dispatch boundary must be conservative. Batch 4 long-context cases are slower,
so this path should only be considered for shared-prefix decode with at least
batch 8, and batch 16 is the robust target.

Gate: keep `shared_prefix_gqa_decode_attention` as an explicit experimental
entry point. The next implementation must add online-softmax merge for
request-local suffix tokens, then profile `b16/c4096` with Nsight to verify the
expected reduction in repeated K/V traffic before any vLLM scheduler hook.

Prefix-aware packed decode attention v2 with suffix merge:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/home/hhai/l20-stack/src /home/hhai/venvs/vllm-l20/bin/python \
  scripts/benchmark_shared_prefix_suffix_decode_attention.py \
  --batches 8,16 \

  --iterations 20 \
  --output benchmarks/results/l20-shared-prefix-suffix-decode/b8-b16-p1k-p4k-s64-s256-v1.json
```

The v2 path computes shared-prefix partials as `(m, l, acc)`, computes
request-local suffix partials with the existing split-KV kernel, and merges both
regions with a log-sum-exp reduce. This is the first complete prefix+suffix
semantic path rather than a shared-prefix-only microbenchmark.

All rows are correctness-checked against PyTorch SDPA with max absolute error
at or below `0.001`. The implementation also fixed a real split-KV limitation:
the reduce kernel now supports non-power-of-two split counts by using a masked
power-of-two reduction tile, which is required for realistic prefix+suffix
lengths such as 1024+64.

Updated gate: do not enable this path for 1K shared prefixes. Enablement should
start at shared prefix length >= 4096 and batch >= 8, with batch 16 as the
high-confidence target. The next system step is a scheduler-facing prototype:
detect requests sharing the same prefix-cache block chain, run this packed
prefix+suffix path, and compare vLLM TPOT/ITL against normal PagedAttention.

Paged shared-prefix follow-up:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/home/hhai/l20-stack/src /home/hhai/venvs/vllm-l20/bin/python \
  scripts/benchmark_shared_paged_prefix_suffix_decode_attention.py \

```

This version replaces the contiguous shared prefix with a vLLM-shaped page-16
NHD KV cache plus a shared 1D prefix block table. It keeps the same suffix merge
logic, so the comparison isolates page-table and page-layout overhead.

Random page order stays close to contiguous pages:

```text

16    4096   64     paged 0.16179 ms, 2.69x over baseline, 0.962x vs contiguous
16    4096   256    paged 0.16486 ms, 2.71x over baseline, 0.960x vs contiguous
16    8192   64     paged 0.24422 ms, 3.27x over baseline, 0.954x vs contiguous
16    8192   256    paged 0.24781 ms, 3.29x over baseline, 0.955x vs contiguous
```

All paged rows are correctness-checked against PyTorch SDPA. The page-table
overhead is about 3-5% in the high-confidence B16 cases, which is small enough
to justify a vLLM prototype. The next gate is no longer a synthetic contiguous
layout; it is a scheduler hook that groups requests by shared prefix-cache block
chain and reports real TPOT/ITL.

vLLM import-path dispatch smoke:

max_abs_error: 0.00048828125
```

This validates the vLLM-facing boundary without patching the backend yet:
`install_l20_shared_prefix_decode.py` copies the decode op and dispatch helper
into `vllm.v1.attention.ops`, the dispatch gate groups an all-shared-prefix
batch by identical prefix block chain, and the vLLM import path calls the L20
paged prefix+suffix kernel correctly. The remaining work is the real backend
hook: feed prefix-cache block tables and suffix KV from vLLM's decode metadata,
then compare TPOT/ITL with tracing enabled.

Backend trace hook:

```bash
VLLM_SOURCE_TREE=/home/hhai/vllm-l20-upstream \
PYTHONPATH=/home/hhai/l20-stack:/home/hhai/l20-stack/src:/home/hhai/vllm-l20-upstream \
  /home/hhai/venvs/vllm-l20/bin/python integrations/vllm/install_l20_shared_prefix_decode.py
```

The installer now also patches the FlashInfer backend's native decode path with
a trace-only hook:

```text
trace_l20_shared_prefix_decode_candidate(
    decode_query,
    kv_cache_permute,
    attn_metadata.decode.block_tables,
    attn_metadata.decode.seq_lens,
    page_size=kv_cache_permute.shape[2],
)
```

Validation:

```text
benchmarks/results/l20-shared-prefix-vllm-dispatch/smoke-b8-p4k-s64-trace.json
should_dispatch: true
trace_candidate: true
correct: true
max_abs_error: 0.00048828125

event: shared_prefix_decode_candidate
eligible: true
candidate_prefix: 4096
group_sizes: [8]
reason_if_not_run: paged_suffix_not_implemented
```

This is deliberately not an end-to-end speed claim. It proves the backend can
load the patch and observe real decode metadata through the vLLM import path.
The blocker is now precise: current executable kernels support paged shared
prefix plus contiguous suffix, while real vLLM decode suffix tokens are still in
the paged KV cache. The next kernel step is paged-suffix scanning/merge, after
which this trace hook can become an output-producing dispatch path.

Paged suffix kernel:

```bash

max_abs_error <= 0.00048828125
```

This resolves the trace hook's `paged_suffix_not_implemented` blocker at the
kernel level: both shared prefix and private suffix now read from paged KV
cache block tables. The result is still not a vLLM serving-speed claim. The
full paged path is 24-31% slower than the paged-prefix plus contiguous-suffix
oracle because suffix scanning is a separate paged pass. Keep this path
experimental until either a small-suffix fused path removes the extra launch or
real grouped-prefix vLLM ITL shows the remaining overhead is acceptable.
